I was once a pretty heavy Maple Story player. I wrote this tool to aid in data-mining the game's asset archives for new / unreleased content; the assets it extracted also saw frequent use in community fan art.

I haven't compiled it in years, but figured I should upload it for the sake of posterity, if nothing else.
